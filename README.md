## 🎯 Purpose

Built for my mother who has PSP and is nearly blind - she can feel and press tactile buttons but cannot use touchscreens or phones. This device enables communication through large, tactile letter-shaped buttons that play specific audio messages.

## ✨ Features

- **32+ Large Tactile Buttons**: Easy-to-feel letter buttons for accessibility
- **Multi-Press Support**: Press same button multiple times for different phrases (e.g., "T" → Thirsty, Tired, Toilet)
- **High-Quality Audio**: VS1053 codec for superior sound quality via built-in speaker
- **Fully Offline**: No internet required - all audio stored locally on SD card
- **USB-C Power**: Simple, reliable power connection
- **Custom Mapping**: Easy CSV-based button-to-phrase mapping system

## 🔧 Hardware Components

- **Arduino Uno R4 WiFi** - Main microcontroller
- **Adafruit VS1053 Music Maker Shield** - High-quality audio playback
- **2x PCF8575 I²C Port Expanders** - Support for 32+ buttons
- **Large Arcade/Tactile Buttons** - Accessible button interface
- **MicroSD Card (FAT32)** - Local audio storage
- **Speaker** - Clear audio output
- **USB-C Power Module** - Reliable power supply

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Hardware Setup**: See **/hardware/documentation/bill-of-materials.csv** for complete parts list and **/hardware/wiring-diagrams** for connections.
2. **Firmware**: Flash `/firmware/tactile_comm_device_vs1053/tactile_comm_device_vs1053.ino`
3. **Audio Setup**: Format SD card as FAT32, copy audio files to proper folders
4. **Configuration**: Add `config.csv` to SD card root (see `/config/sample_config.csv`)
5. **Power On**: Connect USB-C power, open Serial monitor @ 115200 baud

## 🎵 Audio Organization

Audio files are organized in numbered folders on the SD card:
- `/01/` - Special buttons (YES, NO, WATER, HELP)
- `/05/` - Letter A variations
- `/06/` - Letter B variations
- And so on...

Each folder contains numbered MP3 files (001.mp3, 002.mp3, etc.) that correspond to multiple presses of the same button.

## 🗺️ Button Mapping

The device supports both recorded human speech and generated TTS audio:
- **1st Press**: Clear TTS voice (consistent pronunciation)
- **2nd Press**: Personal recorded words (familiar voices)
- **3rd+ Press**: Additional variations

Example for button "A":
1. "Apple" (TTS)
2. "Amer" (recorded)
3. "Alari" (recorded)
4. "Arabic" (TTS)

## 🛠️ Configuration

Use Serial monitor commands:
- `C` - Enter calibration mode to assign button labels
- `P` - Print current button mappings
- `+/-` - Adjust volume
- `1-9` - Set specific volume levels
- `T` - Test all configured buttons
- `X` - Stop current audio playback
