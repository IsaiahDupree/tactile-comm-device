# 005.mp3 should contain: SD card instructions. To add new words or sounds, place audio files inside the SD card folders. Human recordings go in /audio/human/[LETTER]. Generated voices go in /audio/generated/[LETTER]. Each file should be named in order, starting with 001.mp3, 002.mp3, and so on. When you press a button multiple times, the device will cycle through those files. If there are three files and you press four times, it loops back to the first file. You can also add files without numbering; the device will still cycle through them in the order it finds them. After copying files, remove the SD card safely, put it back into the device, and press the reset button. Now, pressing the matching letter button will speak your new sound. Use the Period button, pressed four times, to switch between Human First and Generated First mode, which changes which folder is played first.
