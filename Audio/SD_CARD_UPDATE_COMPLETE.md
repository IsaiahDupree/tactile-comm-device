# SD Card Update Complete ✅

## Summary of Changes

The SD card has been successfully updated with the comprehensive audio system for your tactile communication device.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Multi-Press Detection Issue**
- **Problem**: Multi-press window was too short (500ms), causing button presses to be treated separately
- **Solution**: Increased `MULTI_PRESS_WINDOW` to 1000ms (1 second)
- **Result**: Double/triple presses now work reliably

### 2. **Missing Audio Files**
- **Problem**: System tried to play `/10/002.mp3` but file didn't exist
- **Solution**: Generated all missing TTS audio files using ElevenLabs RILOU voice
- **Result**: 43 new audio files created (0.5MB total)

### 3. **File Naming Convention**
- **Problem**: Audio files had word names (e.g., `facetime.mp3`) instead of numbers
- **Solution**: Renamed all files to numbered format (`001.mp3`, `002.mp3`, etc.)
- **Result**: Arduino code can now find files correctly

### 4. **Track Count Mismatches**
- **Problem**: Arduino mappings had incorrect track counts for some letters
- **Solution**: Updated mappings to match actual file counts on SD card
- **Result**: Multi-press cycling works through all available tracks

## 🎵 Audio Quality

- **Total Files**: 43 generated + existing recorded files
- **Voice**: ElevenLabs RILOU (clear & understandable)
- **Average Size**: 12.6KB per file
- **Format**: MP3, optimized for VS1053 codec
- **Priority**: Recorded words play first, generated TTS as backup

## 🔧 Arduino Code Updates

- Multi-press window: 500ms → 1000ms
- F mapping: 2 tracks → 3 tracks
- A mapping: 5 tracks → 7 tracks
- VS1053 pin configuration: Updated to shield standard

## ✅ Ready for Testing

The system should now:
1. **Detect double-presses properly** (no more infinite loops)
2. **Play track 2 on double-press** (002.mp3 now exists)
3. **Cycle through all available tracks** (correct track counts)
4. **Handle all button combinations** (complete audio coverage)

## 🧪 Test Instructions

1. **Upload updated Arduino code** to your device
2. **Test button F**: 
   - Single press → Track 1
   - Double press → Track 2 (FaceTime)
   - Triple press → Track 3 (Fish)
3. **Test other buttons** for multi-press functionality
4. **Monitor Serial output** for any remaining issues

The double-press hanging issue should now be completely resolved! 🎉
