5V      â†’ VCC
GND     â†’ GND
Pin 10  â†’ RX
Pin 11  â†’ TX

DFPlayer â†’ Speaker
SPK_1   â†’ Speaker +
SPK_2   â†’ Speaker -
```

#### Step 3: Upload Arduino Code
1. Open `tactile_communicator_pcf8575.ino`
2. Connect Arduino via USB
3. Select correct board and COM port
4. Click Upload
5. Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)

### Phase 2: Initial Testing (15 minutes)

#### Power-On Test:
1. Insert SD card into DFPlayer Mini
2. Connect power to Arduino
3. Check Serial Monitor for startup messages:
   ```
   Initializing Tactile Communication Device...
   SD card initialized.
   Loading default mappings...
   PCF8575 #0 (0x20) online
   PCF8575 #1 (0x21) online
   DFPlayer Mini online.
   Device ready for communication!
   ```

#### Audio Test Commands (via Serial):
- Type `T` â†’ Test all buttons automatically
- Type `V` â†’ Check current volume
- Type `P` â†’ Print current button mappings
- Type `H` â†’ Show help menu

### Phase 3: Button Calibration (30 minutes)

#### Button Wiring:
Connect your 32 tactile buttons to:
- **PCF8575 #0**: Buttons for YES, NO, WATER, AUX + Letters A-N
- **PCF8575 #1**: Buttons for Letters O-Z + SPACE, PERIOD

#### Calibration Process:
1. In Serial Monitor, type `C` (Calibration mode)
2. Press each button and verify correct label appears
3. If wrong, type new label and press Enter
4. Type `E` to exit calibration
5. Type `S` to save configuration to SD card

### Phase 4: Priority Audio Testing

#### Test Recorded Words:
Test these buttons to hear your personal recordings:

**Letter A** (Press 1-2 times):
- 1 press â†’ "Amer" [YOUR VOICE]
- 2 presses â†’ "Alari" [YOUR VOICE]

**Letter L** (Press 1-2 times):
- 1 press â†’ "Lee" [YOUR VOICE]  
- 2 presses â†’ "I love you" [YOUR VOICE]

**Letter D** (Press 1-2 times):
- 1 press â†’ "Deen" [YOUR VOICE]
- 2 presses â†’ "Daddy" [YOUR VOICE]

#### Multi-Press Testing:
- Press button once â†’ Wait 0.5 seconds â†’ Should play track 1
- Press button twice quickly â†’ Wait 0.5 seconds â†’ Should play track 2
- Continue for all assigned tracks

### Phase 5: Final Enclosure Assembly

#### Mechanical Assembly:
1. **Secure Arduino** in enclosure with standoffs
2. **Mount PCF8575 chips** near button matrix
3. **Install DFPlayer Mini** with easy SD card access
4. **Position speaker** for optimal sound projection
5. **Route battery compartment** for easy charging
6. **Secure all connections** with proper strain relief

#### Button Installation:
1. **Insert tactile buttons** through enclosure holes
2. **Connect button matrix** to PCF8575 GPIO pins
3. **Test each button** for proper mechanical action
4. **Verify electrical connectivity** via calibration mode

### Phase 6: Final Testing & Validation

#### Functional Tests:
- [ ] All 32 buttons respond correctly
- [ ] Multi-press cycling works (1-5 presses per button)
- [ ] Recorded words play in correct positions
- [ ] Generated words fill remaining slots
- [ ] Audio quality is clear and appropriate volume
- [ ] Battery life meets requirements (8+ hours)

#### User Acceptance:
- [ ] Familiar voices (recorded words) sound natural
- [ ] Button layout is intuitive and accessible
- [ ] Device powers on/off reliably
- [ ] Charging system works properly
- [ ] Volume level is appropriate for user

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Criteria

### Device is ready when:
1. **All buttons mapped** and responding correctly
2. **Recorded words playing** in priority positions
3. **Multi-press cycling** working smoothly
4. **Audio quality** meets user needs
5. **Mechanical assembly** robust and user-friendly
6. **Battery system** provides adequate runtime

## ðŸ“ž Support During Assembly

### Troubleshooting Common Issues:

**No Serial Response:**
- Check Arduino connection and COM port
- Verify 115200 baud rate in Serial Monitor
- Ensure Arduino IDE board selection matches your hardware

**Audio Not Playing:**
- Verify SD card insertion in DFPlayer Mini
- Check speaker connections (SPK_1, SPK_2)
- Test volume command (`V` in Serial Monitor)
- Ensure DFPlayer Mini power connections

**Buttons Not Responding:**
- Enter calibration mode (`C`) to test individual buttons
- Check PCF8575 I2C connections and addresses
- Verify button wiring to GPIO pins
- Test I2C communication (should see PCF8575 online messages)

**Wrong Audio Playing:**
- Check SD card folder/file organization
- Verify button mapping in calibration mode
- Confirm track numbers match press counts
- Review PRIORITY_MAPPING.txt on SD card

## ðŸš€ Next Phase: Delivery

Once assembly and testing are complete:
1. **Final QA testing** with all functions
2. **Create user manual** specific to final configuration  
3. **Package device** with charger and documentation
4. **Ship to California** with tracking and insurance

**Estimated Assembly Time:** 2-3 hours
**Testing Phase:** 1-2 hours
**Total to Completion:** 4-5 hours

You're almost there! The hardest part (software and audio preparation) is complete. Now it's just methodical hardware assembly and testing.
