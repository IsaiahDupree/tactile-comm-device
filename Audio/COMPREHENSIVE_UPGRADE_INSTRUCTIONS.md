## **🚀 Step-by-Step Upgrade Process:**

### **Step 1: Connect SD Card**
1. Insert your SD card into computer
2. Note the drive letter (usually E:\ or F:\)

### **Step 2: Place Your Recorded Words**
1. Copy your personal recorded audio files to:
   ```
   C:\Users\Isaia\Documents\3D Printing\Projects\Button\Audio\RecordedWords\
   ```

2. **Name them according to this system:**
   ```
   yes_recorded.mp3          → Your personal "Yes"
   no_recorded.mp3           → Your personal "No"  
   water_recorded.mp3        → Your personal "Water"
   deen.mp3                  → Your son Deen
   daddy.mp3                 → Your voice saying "Daddy"
   lee.mp3                   → Your voice saying "Lee"
   i_love_you.mp3           → Your voice saying "I love you"
   kiyah.mp3                → Your voice saying "Kiyah"
   kyan.mp3                 → Your voice saying "Kyan"
   good_morning.mp3         → Your voice saying "Good Morning"
   susu.mp3                 → Your voice saying "Susu"
   nadowie.mp3              → Your voice saying "Nadowie"
   noah.mp3                 → Your voice saying "Noah"
   urgent_care.mp3          → Your voice saying "Urgent Care"
   walker.mp3               → Your voice saying "Walker"
   wheelchair.mp3           → Your voice saying "Wheelchair"
   ```

### **Step 3: Run the Comprehensive Upgrade**
1. **Update the script** with correct SD card path if needed
2. **Run the upgrade:**
   ```bash
   python comprehensive_audio_upgrade.py
   ```

### **Step 4: Upload Updated Arduino Code**
The Arduino code now includes:
- **Audio interruption** (max 5 seconds per clip)
- **Named file support** 
- **Multi-press priority system**
- **Enhanced logging** with clear indicators

## **🎵 New File Structure:**

### **Priority 1 (First Press): Generated TTS**
```
Folder 05 (A): apple.mp3         → Clear "Apple"
Folder 06 (B): ball.mp3          → Clear "Ball"  
Folder 07 (C): cat.mp3           → Clear "Cat"
Folder 08 (D): dog.mp3           → Clear "Dog"
...and so on for all letters
```

### **Priority 2 (Second Press): Your Recorded Words**
```
Folder 05 (A): amer.mp3, alari.mp3    → Your personal recordings
Folder 06 (B): bye.mp3                → Your personal "Bye"
Folder 08 (D): deen.mp3, daddy.mp3    → Your family names
Folder 15 (K): kiyah.mp3, kyan.mp3    → Your family names
Folder 16 (L): lee.mp3, i_love_you.mp3 → Your personal messages
```

## **🔄 How Multi-Press Works:**

1. **Single Press**: Plays generated TTS (clear, consistent)
   - Button C → `cat.mp3` (Priority 1)
   
2. **Double Press**: Plays your recorded words (personal)
   - Button C → `chair.mp3` (Priority 2, if available)
   
3. **Triple Press**: Cycles through additional words
   - Button C → `car.mp3` (Priority 3, if available)

## **🛡️ Audio Interruption Features:**

- **Maximum 5 seconds** per audio clip
- **Automatic stop** for long files  
- **Press any button** to interrupt current audio
- **No more stuck audio** playback

## **✅ Quality Improvements:**

### **RILOU Voice Benefits:**
- ✅ **Crystal clear pronunciation**
- ✅ **Natural speech rhythm**
- ✅ **Consistent volume levels**
- ✅ **Optimized for assistive technology**

### **File Management:**
- ✅ **Descriptive filenames** (apple.mp3, not 001.mp3)
- ✅ **Organized by priority** (generated vs recorded)
- ✅ **Compact file sizes** (average ~15KB each)
- ✅ **Professional organization**

## **🎯 Expected Results:**

After the upgrade, your system will have:
- **Complete alphabet coverage** with clear TTS
- **Personal recorded words** as second option
- **Professional audio quality** throughout
- **Reliable audio interruption**
- **Future-proof file organization**

## **🔧 Troubleshooting:**

### **If SD Card Not Detected:**
1. Check drive letter in script
2. Ensure SD card is FAT32 formatted
3. Update `SD_CARD_PATH` variable

### **If TTS Generation Fails:**
1. Verify API key is correct
2. Check internet connection  
3. Try smaller batches of files

### **If Recorded Files Don't Play:**
1. Verify files are in RecordedWords folder
2. Check file naming matches exactly
3. Ensure MP3 format and reasonable file sizes
