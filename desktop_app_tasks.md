# Tactile Communication Device - Desktop App Development Tasks

This document outlines the development plan for a comprehensive UI application that will interface with the tactile communication device.

## Application Goals

* Allow users to edit per-letter **Human (orange)** and **Generated (blue)** audio mappings
* Display **device + SD card status** with a one-click health check
* Mirror the **physical layout** of the device (7√ó4 grid + top quick-phrases)
* Support unlimited mappings per letter through playlist management
